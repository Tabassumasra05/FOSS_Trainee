# An incident 

Once  I was forming team for a coding contest. Most of the girls I knew were more into C,while I was comfortable with C++. So I decided to ask a few boys who were good at it

The worst part is as soon I asked, they suddenly said they'd already made a team ,even though I  knew (by some other means)they didn't.😅

That moment made me realised that sometimes people decide your capability before they even know you.However I found some like minded teammates and we gave our best.

and guess what? Our team secured 2nd place.😊

To be honest, though this incident made me feel bad at the beginning but I realised many things through this


# Expectations vs Reality

Before I entered college, I was so sure that I’d never be like those students who study just 1 or 2 days before exams.
I believed I would be consistent,focused,and probably even enjoy every single day like a dream. 

But then , the realization began.
College had its own plans , the study daily part disappeared faster than the light speed, and enjoy every day turned into let’s just survive this week.😔

Sleep schedules got creative, assignments came out of nowhere, and exams arrived like surprise guests.

But somewhere in these chaos,❤️ I found something I didn’t expect — the best friends who made even the dullest lectures feel alive.
Now, I might not be living the dream I imagined, but I’m living something far better — a story full of laughter, midnight snacks, and people who make it all worth it.
